Add security declaration and clarify installation for OpenClaw users:

- Add Security & Privacy section with keychain storage explanation
- Add Credential Storage Summary table
- Split Installation into OpenClaw and CLI sections
- Clarify OpenClaw users don't need external npm packages
- Add Security Disclosure section with vulnerability reporting

This addresses the 'Suspicious' security scan label by providing
transparency about security architecture and data handling practices.
